# Introduction

Hello! I'm Kai Fang and I'm a young and passionate software developer with a Bachelor of Computing from NUS. I have participated in several group programming projects during my course of study in NUS and learnt many fundamental aspects of software engineering, testing and security.

I'm familiar with popular programming languages such as Java, Python, JavaScript and learnt other interesting languages on my own time. Some of those include Go, SQL, C++ and Rust. I have also started learning some frameworks that I found really useful, such as React, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA and Spring Security. Some of my personal projects focus on one or a combination of languages and frameworks. I hope you will find them at least somewhat interesting (some of them might not be pushed to github yet).

I have experience with fullstack, AI and mobile development. The frontend frameworks I've used are VueJs and React. For the backend, I am familiar with message queueing with RabbitMQ, Docker, Websockets, OAuth, and backend frameworks like NodeJs and Django. I am currently looking to explore different programming languages and the possibilities for each language. I look forward to many learning opportunities, whether in cybersecurity, game engine development, or desktop applications.

Cheers!
