# Introduction

Hello! I'm Kai Fang and I'm a young and passionate Computer Science student at NUS. I have participated in some group programming projects during my course of study in NUS and learnt many fundamental aspects of software engineering.

I'm familiar with popular programming languages such as Java, Python, JavaScript and learnt other interesting languages on my own time. Some of those include Go, SQL, C++ and Rust. I have also started learning some frameworks that I found really useful, such as React, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA and Spring Security. Some of my personal projects focus on one or a combination of languages and frameworks. I hope you will find them at least somewhat interesting (some of them might not be pushed to github yet).

 My current goal is to master software engineering skills and learn DevOps. I have relevant experience in fullstack development and I would like to apply and further enhance these skills.

Cheers!
