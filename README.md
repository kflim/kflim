# Introduction

Hello! I'm Kai Fang and I'm a young and passionate Computer Science student at NUS. I have participated in some group programming projects during my course of study in NUS and learnt many fundamental aspects of software engineering.

I'm familiar with popular programming languages such as Java, Python, JavaScript and learnt other interesting languages on my own time. Some of those include Go, SQL and C++. I have also started learning some frameworks that I found really useful, such as React, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA and Spring Security. Some of my personal projects focus on one or a combination of languages and frameworks. I hope you will find them at least somewhat interesting (some of them might not be pushed to github yet).

As of now, one of my main goals is to become familiar with full-stack development for the honest-to-god reason of getting hired! (And also because I really want to make full-fledged deployable software on my own to satisfy my ego). 

Cheers!
